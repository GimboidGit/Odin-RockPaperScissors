This was a lot of fun to do. 

As of 14/06/2022, I have uploaded my first version. Later assignments revisit the Project in order to improve them.

Even though the Odin Project revisits this project, I have a number of TO DOs:
- Make it clear that you're going to play five rounds
- Report detailed results of each round.
